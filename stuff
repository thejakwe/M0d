Stuff I'd like to accomplish

Port to Eris
- better all around than discord.js
  - mainly because of caching and event discarding
- shouldn't be to hard

Make Public
- would need a web dashboard, I have no clue about front end web stuff
- would be a pain to set up and mainly take a lot of time

yeah cool if you wanna help dm me on discord
